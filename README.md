# UserManagementProj
This is a mini project using c# web API, HTML, CSS and JS for creating a user login page with rest api My main focus was on working on/learning API, authentication and authorization.
I already had the front-end code and mostly just wrote the api part of it.
The developing and testing of the APIs were done using Swagger and Apidog This was done to learn and implement the topics I mentioned.
